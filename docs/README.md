# Fallat贸l

_Fallat贸l_ is a collection of micro libraries stemming from patterns I find myself using repeatedly for my personal
projects and sometimes professionally. I decided to start collecting them all in one place so I could easily re-use
them.

## Libraries
* [`fallatol-config`](config.md) - A Scala idiomatic wrapper around [`sconfig`](https://github.com/ekrich/sconfig/).

### Name
_Fallat贸l_ is a mashup for the Icelandic words _['fall'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fall#Icelandic)_ meaning
a function in programming, and _[t贸l](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/t%C3%B3l#Icelandic)_ meaning tool(s). Icelandic
is a rare enough language that using it in a library name is highly likely to avoid name collisions. Also, I'm part
Icelandic and have started learning the language.
