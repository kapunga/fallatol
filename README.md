# Fallatól - Functional Tools

_Fallatól_ is a collection of micro libraries with patterns I use regularly and find myself rewriting.
I'm collecting them into a single place so I can easily re-use them in my projects.

## Fallatól Config

A collection of typeclasses to be used with the [_sconfig library_](https://github.com/ekrich/sconfig/) to give it a
more Scala-like interface.
